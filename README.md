# DataStructureAlgorithmTUT2021
After completing the course, the student knows the commonly used algorithm design techniques. The student can implement basic data structures independently, and knows how to apply related algorithms to them. The student is able to analyze the asymptotic complexity of simple programs and knows how to use library implementations to build more complex data structures.
